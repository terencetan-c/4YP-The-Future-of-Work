@article{MunnellAliciaH2013SSRR,
	abstract = {Social Security was designed to replace income once people could no longer work. In the 1930s, the retirement age was set at 65, which coincided with the age used by many private and public pension plans. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Congress changed the law to enable workers to claim benefits as early as 62. But benefits claimed before 65 were actuarially reduced, so that those who claimed at 62 and those who claimed at 65 could expect to receive about the same total amount in benefits over their lifetimes. In the early 1970s, Congress introduced the Delayed Retirement Credit, which increased monthly benefits for those who claimed after the so-called Full Retirement Age of 65. That credit, which was modest at first, now fully compensates for delayed claiming. As a result, lifetime benefits are roughly equal for any claiming age between 62 and 70, and the highest monthly benefits are available at 70. In that regard, 70 has become the new 65. Moreover, the level of monthly benefits at 70 appears appropriate given the increased deductions for Medicare premiums, the greater taxation of benefits, the declining importance of the spouses' benefit, and the diminished sources of other retirement income. This brief aims to clarify Social Security's current benefit structure. The discussion proceeds as follows. The first section describes how 70 became Social Security's new retirement age. The second section explores whether 70 is the "right" age by looking at "equivalency" to 65, the increasing dispersion in life expectancy by socioeconomic status, and actual retirement patterns. The third section looks at the Social Security replacement rates that workers will face at different retirement ages. The fourth section clarifies that with the maturation of the Delayed Retirement Credit, the "Full Retirement Age" no longer describes the benefit structure; further increases in this benchmark simply reduce replacement rates for everyone. The final section presents a threefold conclusion. First, the shift to age 70 may be appropriate given the increase in life expectancy, health, and education for the majority of workers, but will lead to low replacement rates for the many workers who retire early. Second, further cuts in benefits by extending the Full Retirement Age will lead to very low benefits for early retirees. Third, policymakers need to inform those who can work that 70 is the new retirement age and devise ways to protect those who cannot work.},

As the largest country in the world, China experienced a demographic transition at a historic scale during the past 50 years with extraordinarily associated changes in the age structure of the population, declining fertility rates, accelerating process of population aging, and growing population scale.
What is added by this report?
This study presented future trends of five important population indicators in China. From 2015-2050, China experienced outstanding demographic changes - increases in life expectancy and declines in fertility rate - that have led to population aging. In addition, disability prevalence is growing, and life expectancy with disability is also increasing.
What are the implications for public health practice?
This study provided evidence of healthy life expectancy improvement and disease burden declining, healthy aging, and active aging. Due to the uncertainties of future trends of population structure changes, dynamic evaluations, timely adjustments, and innovations in population health strategy design and management should be strengthened to ensure quality of life under the background of population aging.},

It highlighted dramatic shortages necessitating bold action and outlined recommendations aimed at building a sizable and qualified workforce. This study updates report findings and progress made on its recommendations. Through review of publicly accessible, internet-based literature and government and professional organization websites, current workforce data and recent policy changes are compared to the report's statistics and recommendations. Direct comparisons are limited by changing definitions, context, and data collection and analyses methods. Future workforce-need projections are estimated using reports from various sources. Inability to forecast medical advances, socioeconomic changes, and world events affects the accuracy of these projections. Nonetheless, clear conclusions emerge despite such limitations. Progress toward fulfilling the IoM goals is variable and insufficient. The current and projected numbers for all geriatric health providers remain inadequate compared to estimated 2030 demand. Challenges in meeting estimated needs persist essentially unchanged. The 2008 IoM framework and recommendations remain relevant and constitute an important roadmap to complete unfinished goals. Initial findings from this update provide a platform for developing practice and policy reforms.},

@article{SteigerwaldDavid2010WRtU,
	abstract = {Historians have slighted the importance of automation both as a cause of organized labor's decline in America and as a lively issue among labor leaders in the early post-WWII period. In part, this disregard stems from labor's own ambivalence about technological change. This essay considers that ambivalence by looking at Walter Reuther and the United Auto Workers. Reuther and his colleagues shared widespread hopes that the new production processes would relieve the burdens of assembly-line work and increase the working class's access to cultivated leisure. At the same time, however, they recognized that unchecked technological change would generate a wave of structural unemployment by displacing experienced workers while denying new, unskilled workers necessary jobs. Reuther and his colleagues feared that automation in this form would destroy the consumer capacity that the working class had so recently acquired, and in so doing would undermine the health of the entire economy. Reuther's strategy, therefore, was not to resist automation but to manage its implementation through both collective bargaining and progressive political victories.},

Arguably more important, and quite specific to the US, were the non-wage benefits, typified by the comprehensive health insurance and pension benefits that have long been available to employees in US auto assembly plants. Contractor (2021) raises several potential causal mechanisms: globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing jobs, increases in productivity that have been enabled by automation and other technological advances (e.g., information and communications technology), and a power shift between industrial labor unions and companies. During the severe downturn in the US automotive industry of the 1980s, surprisingly large numbers of former automotive assembly workers chose to remain in the `rust belt', rather than relocating to distant states to seek employment in other industries (e.g., the then-expanding oil industry in Texas), despite very limited job options at home.},

abstract={Many optimization problems are naturally delivered in an uncertain framework, and one would like to exercise prudence against the uncertainty elements present in the problem. In previous contributions, it has been shown that solutions to uncertain convex programs that bear a high probability to satisfy uncertain constraints can be obtained at low computational cost through constraint randomization. In this paper, we establish new feasibility results for randomized algorithms. Specifically, the exact feasibility for the class of the so-called fully-supported problems is obtained. It turns out that all fully-supported problems share the same feasibility properties, revealing a deep kinship among problems of this class. It is further proven that the feasibility of the randomized solutions for all other convex programs can be bounded based on the feasibility for the prototype class of fully-supported problems. The feasibility result of this paper outperforms previous bounds and is not improvable because it is exact for fully-supported problems.},

The large sample size of the Scientific Use File of the pension inflow statistics (n = 29933) allows a differentiated analysis considering multiple dimensions. Using key demographic indicators such as sex, region, length of career and pension payments, we demonstrate the effects of the level of education on the age of retirement, measured in years between 60 and 65 or older. Our analysis shows that high skilled retire later than low skilled employees. The difference is smaller than one year. But the beginning of the high skilled careers is round about two years later, with higher pension payments. Based on this findings, we discuss to which extent skills can lengthen the lifetime career with respect to pull and push factors.},

@article{ParsonsAlexanderJ.Q.2018Aeof,
	abstract = {Japan's ongoing struggle with rapid ageing is well known. Fertility and migration policies have both been proposed as solutions to Japan's ageing population. We used stock flow population models to estimate the impact of hypothetical fertility and migration policy interventions on measures of aging in Japan from 2015 to 2050. We evaluated policy models based on the Old Age Dependency Ratio (OADR) they produced at the specified end date. Start dates ranged from 2020 to 2030 to assess the time horizons of individual policies. Fertility policies were found to be highly time dependent and only slowed the rate of increase of OADR. It would require a Total Fertility Rate far above replacement levels to compensate for Japan's already aged demography. Migration policy was less time dependent. However, such measures would require unprecedented, and ultimately unrealistic, volumes of migration over coming decades in order to reduce Japan's OADR. Our results suggest that fertility and migration based policy responses will be unable to significantly reduce Japan's OADR or reverse Japan's ageing population within the next few decades. Japan should focus on activating its human capital through the prolongation of working lives, increasing participation, and improving productivity within the Japanese labour force to mitigate and adapt to the inevitable effects of ageing populations.},

	abstract = {Automation and population aging are two major forces that will shape the nature of works in the future. However, it is not clear how these forces will interact with each other and affect the labor market. This paper examines the interaction effects of computerization and population aging on the labor market. We found that computerization and population aging have large and statistically significant effects on employment growth but not earnings growth. Also, their interaction terms are statistically significant only for employment growth but not for earnings growth.},
